# 2D-Breaker
A simple cross platform 2D arcade game using OpenGL API and Irrklang sound engine.

# Mechanics of the game
1. There is a small paddle that is controlled by the player. 
2. There is a ball that will destroy the bricks if it touches them.
3. If the ball reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses.
4. The player wins as soon as all bricks are destroyed.
5. The direction of the ball can be manipulated by how far the ball bounces from the paddle's center.

# Note
The aim of this project is to delve deeper into game development and graphics programming. In order to understand the different concepts associated with game development, I took up OpenGL API to reinforce the basics. This project is very small compared to the real world examples and there are a lot of improvements that can be made to make it scalable and more user-friendly.
